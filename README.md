# PSTAT-115-Bayesian-Analysis
All files are assignments I completed individually for my Bayesian Analysis course. Projects were completed in R through a JupyterHub Server and used STAN modeling at times.
Homework 1 covers a text analysis of Harry Potter.
Homework 2 covers conjugacy pairs.
Homework 3 covers posterior predictive modeling and model checking.
Homework 4 covers the Bayesian posterior interval, Monte Carlo sampling, and implementing STAN models.
Homework 5 covers Markov chain Monte Carlo, the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm, pooling estimators, and shrinkage plots.
